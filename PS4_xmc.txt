### Experiment description ###

Studies within the field of developmental psychology have extensively investigated children’s moral development,
typically looking at how they judge and reason about prototypical moral transgressions such as hitting and 
teasing under different contexts (e.g.,Helwig, Zalozo, & Wilson, 2001; Piaget, 1948; Smetana, Jambon, & Ball, 2016;
Turiel, 2006; Wainryb, 2006). These studies have found that children from a wide range of cultural backgrounds 
consistently judge moral transgressions as wrong, unacceptable, and deserving of punishment. However, less is 
known about what children, or an authority, would/should do next following the transgression. What kind of 
punishment is due to the wrongdoers?  Based on the role of the punisher, the punishment could be fulfilled by 
the victim as personal revenge, or by an authority which is generally viewed as legitimate punishment. Based on 
the focus of the punishment, it could be retributive (perpetrator-oriented), or restorative (victim-oriented). 
This current study seeks to examine how children perceive and evaluate different forms of punishment against 
prototypical moral transgressors.Two hypothetical story vignettes will be used, one describing a scenario of 
physical harm (i.e., a child pushes another off the seesaw; violent transgression) and the other describing 
personal property violation (i.e., a child takes away another child’s desert without asking; non-violent 
transgression). The context of the transgression will vary, being either single-time intentional, repeated 
intentional, or accidental. Next, participants will be presented four possible punishments (personal revenge, 
retributive punishment that makes the transgressor suffer, restorative punishment that benefits the victim, and 
restorative apology), respectively. After each proposed punishment, a series of questions will be asked to examine 
participants’ judgment and reasoning from different angles, e.g., right or wrong, fair or unfair, effective or 
ineffective.
